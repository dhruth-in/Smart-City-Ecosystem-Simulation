# Smart City Ecosystem Simulation using OpenGL

## Overview

This project simulates a **Smart City Ecosystem** using **OpenGL**, demonstrating how modern technologies such as IoT devices, automation, and real-time data systems can be integrated into urban infrastructure to improve efficiency and quality of life.

The simulation highlights the **dynamic interactions** between smart components—like traffic systems, smart buildings, and public utilities—while emphasizing the role of **real-time rendering**, **scalability**, and **sustainability**.

## Key Features

* **3D Visualization** of urban infrastructure and smart devices
* **Real-Time Simulation** of traffic flow, sensor responses, and automated systems
* **Interactive Environment** rendered using OpenGL
* **Modular Components** designed for future extension

## Technologies Used

* **C/C++**
* **OpenGL** for graphical rendering
* **GLUT** for windowing and user interaction
* **Visual Studio 2019** for compilation and debugging on Windows

## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2019 (with Desktop development with C++ workload)
* OpenGL and GLUT libraries configured in the project

## Getting Started

### Steps to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2019**
3. Ensure OpenGL and GLUT are properly linked in project settings
4. Build and run the project

> You can modify components such as traffic logic or device interactions in the source files to simulate different smart city scenarios.
